			<Text>Trade and commerce has been a focal point of civilization since ancient times. Corporations are modern entities that authorizes a company or single group to act as a single entity. Corporations have become the largest facilitators of trade and influence in today's society. In Civilization V, Corporations allow you cement your civilization's wealth and deliver powerful trade benefits to your civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To establish a Corporation, you must secure a Global Monopoly on any of its required resources, and found its Corporation Headquarters. After your Corporation is established, you may construct Offices in your cities and use them to build Franchises in foreign cities via [ICON_INTERNATIONAL_TRADE] Trade Routes.</Text>

Wenn Sie mehr und mehr Kopien derselben Luxusguts sammeln, steigt der Prozentsatz der globalen Ressourcen, die Sie kontrollieren. Wenn dieser Wert über 50 % steigt (d. h. Sie kontrollieren mehr als 50 % des weltweiten Angebots an Ressourcen), erhalten Sie ein globales Monopol über dieses Luxusgut. Jedes globale Monopol hat einen einzigartigen Bonus - einige gewähren zusätzliche Erträge auf Geländefelder, während andere die Erträge der Stadt um einen bestimmten Prozentsatz steigern (siehe Abschnitt Luxusgüter der Civilopedia für Details).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Globale strategische Monopole[ENDCOLOR]: Strategische Ressourcen funktionieren in Bezug auf Monopole genauso wie Luxusgüter, mit einer großen Ausnahme. Aufgrund des riesigen Reichtums an diesen Ressourcen kann ein echtes 50 % Monopol ziemlich schwierig sein. Infolgedessen haben strategische Ressourcen zwei Ebenen: "Strategische" Monopole und "Wahre" Monopole. Strategische Monopole treten bei 25 % auf und generieren spezielle Kampfboni (z. B. erhöhte Gesundheitsregeneration oder erhöhte Verteidigung). Wahre Monopole treten bei 50 % auf und generieren, wie Luxusmonopole, Boni auf die Stadt- und/oder Geländefelder.

They can have a great impact on your empire's economic development, especially in the later part of a game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Founding Corporations[ENDCOLOR]: There are seven distinct Corporations in the game, each of which becomes available once you have researched the Corporations Technology during the Modern Age. Each Corporation has a specific set of Resource Monopolies that it relies upon - if you do not have at least one of these Resource Monopolies, you will not be able to found the Corporation. Once these two requirements are met, you need to construct the 'Headquarters' of the Corporation in one of your Cities. These buildings are World Wonders, so only one player in the world may found each Corporation! Furthermore, once you have founded a Corporation, you cannot found another one, so make sure you like the one you pick![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Building Corporate Offices[ENDCOLOR]: Once you have founded your Corporation, you can begin establishing Corporate Offices in each of your Cities. These buildings come with special bonuses similar to your Corporation's Headquarters, and are thus worthwhile to construct on their own. Most bonuses from Corporations scale with the number of Cities you own, so larger empires benefit greatly from founding a Corporation and building as many Offices as possible!</Text>

			<Text>The word "corporation" derives from corpus, the Latin word for body, or a body of people. By the time of Justinian (reigned 527–565), Roman Law recognized a range of corporate entities under the names universitas, corpus or collegium. These included the state itself (the populus Romanus), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a religious cult, burial clubs, political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.</Text>

			<Text>Nationalization is the process of taking a private industry or private assets into public ownership by a national government or state. Nationalization usually refers to private assets, but may also mean assets owned by lower levels of government, such as municipalities, being transferred to be the state. The opposite of nationalization is usually privatization or de-nationalization, but may also be municipalization. Industries that are usually subject to nationalization include transport, communications, energy, banking and natural resources.</Text>

			<Text>Transnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs. Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization. Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_POLICY_INFILTRATION_TEXT">
			<Text>National syndicalism is an adaptation of syndicalism to suit the social agenda of integral nationalism. National syndicalism suggests that the people must defend themselves through the development of Syndicalist sections into massive economic worker movements. These should take immediate action to expropriate the capitalists. These should also take direct action to let the workers lead the production and to form peoples communes. National syndicalism seeks out principled reasons for direct economic action and denounces parliamentary action by representatives. The goal is not to make capitalism bearable, but the realisation of a free Nationalist and Socialist nation. National syndicalism aims to move the attention from the political terrain to the economic terrain. It wants the socialisation from the basis: a system of distribution from local units, in consultation with the National federation, on the fundament of a production and consumption statistic. As well as the organisation of the production by national industrial federations.</Text>
